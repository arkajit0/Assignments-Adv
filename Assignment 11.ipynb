    "Answer:<br>\n",
    "In object-oriented programming, a metaclass is a class whose instances are classes. Just as an ordinary class defines the behavior of certain objects, a metaclass defines the behavior of certain classes and their instances. Not all object-oriented programming languages support metaclasses."

    "Answer:<br>\n",
    "There are several ways to do this, but one way is to set \\__metaclass\\__ at the module level. This way, all classes of this module will be created using this metaclass, and we just have to tell the metaclass to turn all attributes to uppercase."

    "Answer:<br>\n",
    "In fact, instance creation is not intercepted at all. In this specific case—adding methods to a class when it's created—the choice between metaclasses and decorators is somewhat arbitrary. Decorators can be used to manage both instances and classes, and they intersect with metaclasses in the second of these roles."
