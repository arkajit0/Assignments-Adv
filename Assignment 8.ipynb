    "The exceptions that can be handled are class-based and can be handled between TRY and ENDTRY. The associated exception classes are predefined in the system and begin with the prefix CX_SY_, such as CX_SY_ZERODIVIDE. In the ABAP keyword documentation, the exception classes whose exceptions may occur when a corresponding ABAP statement is executed are listed for each keyword. "
