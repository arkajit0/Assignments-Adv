    "\n",
    "Answer:<br>\n",
    "Basically, a class can be instantiated but a module cannot. A module will never be anything other than a library of methods. A class can be so much more -- it can hold its state (by keeping track of instance variables) and be duplicated as many times as we want."

    "How does a Python class handle operator overloading?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:<br>\n",
    "Python operators work for built-in classes. ... For example, the + operator will perform arithmetic addition on two numbers, merge two lists, or concatenate two strings. This feature in Python that allows the same operator to have different meaning according to the context is called operator overloading."
